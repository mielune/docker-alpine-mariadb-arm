# MariaDB Docker Image With Alpine Linux for ARMHF

Lightweight MariaDB docker image with Alpine Linux. Just ~55MB.

The setup script is based on [official MariaDB docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/), so the usage is the same.

Tank you to [bianjp/docker-mariadb-alpine](https://github.com/bianjp/docker-mariadb-alpine) for the original docker image for  x86 devices.
